# Example for PostgreSQL: "postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public"
DATABASE_URL="your_database_connection_string"

# NextAuth.js - Authentication
# A secret used to sign and encrypt tokens. Generate one: https://generate-secret.vercel.app/
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your_nextauth_secret"
# The canonical URL of your site.
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email (for NextAuth passwordless login, etc.)
